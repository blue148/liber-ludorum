# Product Requirements Document — Web App (DRAFT)

> **Status:** Draft · **Last updated:** 2026-06-15 · **Surface:** Responsive web (React + Vite)
> Companion document: [`PRD_FLUTTER_APP.md`](./PRD_FLUTTER_APP.md) (mobile). The two
> apps share one backend, one data model, and one visual language; this PRD owns the
> web surface and is the **source of truth for the shared design system** unless
> noted otherwise.

## 1. Product Overview

A board game collection-management application for hobbyists who own physical
games and play them socially ("game nights"). Users catalogue what they own,
track a wishlist, look games up by barcode, browse friends' collections, and use
a set of "Game Nite" utilities (pick a game, pick a first player, time turns and
sessions) during play. Play sessions and per-player victories are recorded to
power stats.

- **Internal/package name:** `libre-ludorum` ("Libre Ludorum" — *a free and open
  board game collection management application*).
- **In-app branding (current):** "Churtern•Play" (top nav / mobile header).
- **Backend:** Supabase (Postgres + Row-Level Security, Auth, Storage, Edge
  Functions). The frontend talks only to Supabase; third-party lookups (BoardGameGeek,
  barcode databases) are proxied through Edge Functions so API tokens stay server-side.

> ⚠️ **Open branding decision.** Product identity is inconsistent across surfaces
> ("Libre Ludorum" / "Churtern•Play" / "The Catalogue" / "Churntern Play" on
> mobile). A single product name, wordmark, and bundle identity should be decided
> and applied across both apps. Tracked as a launch blocker on mobile
> (see Flutter PRD §8).

## 2. Goals & Non-Goals

### Goals
- Make cataloguing a physical collection fast (barcode scan + BGG enrichment, or
  manual entry).
- Give a confident "what should we play / who goes first" answer at the table.
- Turn play history into lightweight, motivating stats.
- Let friends see and suggest from each other's collections.

### Non-Goals (current)
- Marketplace / transactions (a `for_sale` flag exists but there is no commerce flow).
- Real-time multi-device session sync during play.
- Rules reference / how-to-play content.
- Social feed / activity stream beyond friends' library browsing.

## 3. Users & Roles

| Role | How it's set | Capabilities |
|------|--------------|--------------|
| Authenticated user | Supabase Auth (email) | Full personal collection, wishlist, sessions, friends, Game Nite tools |
| Admin | `profiles.is_admin = true` | Everything above **plus** the Admin panel (catalog/data management) |
| Friend (viewer) | `shared_library_access` grant | Read (`view`) or read+suggest (`suggest`) on another user's collection |

---

## 4. Information Architecture & Navigation

Top-level tabs (state-driven, single-page; no URL router today):

- **Dashboard** — stats and quick actions; the landing tab.
- **Game Nite Tools** — Game Chooser, First Player, Turn Timer, Game Timer.
- **My Catalogue** (Library) — collection + wishlist, filtering, add/edit, scanner.
- **Admin** — admin-only catalog/data management.
- **Profile** — account, friends, shared libraries, preferences (drawer on desktop,
  full page on mobile).

**Responsive model:**
- **Desktop (`md+`):** sticky top nav with wordmark; the active tab is marked by a
  decorative 3D "wooden disc" indicator. Profile opens as a right-hand drawer.
- **Mobile (`< md`):** slim top header (wordmark + avatar button) and a fixed
  bottom tab bar; Profile becomes a full-page tab. Page content reserves bottom
  padding to clear the fixed nav.

> The web app is genuinely responsive and is the de-facto mobile web experience.
> The Flutter app is a separate native surface, not a wrapper.

## 5. Feature Requirements

### 5.1 Authentication & Account
- Email-based sign-in/up via Supabase Auth (`AuthForm`).
- Profile auto-provisioned with `preferences` (theme, notifications, default view,
  saved player names, game-timer state), `total_games`, `favorite_count`, `is_admin`.
- In-app account deletion supported via the `delete-account` Edge Function.

### 5.2 Library / "My Catalogue"
- Collection view of owned games with cover art, metadata, and per-game victory stats.
- **Wishlist** as a parallel list (`priority`: high/medium/low, notes).
- Per-entry attributes: `is_favorite`, `for_sale`, `personal_ranking`
  (high/medium/low), `played_dates`, `notes`.
- **Filtering** (`FilterSection`, `MultiSelectDropdown`) across game metadata
  (type, category, mechanic, player count, playtime, etc.).
- **Grid / list** view preference (persisted in `profiles.preferences.default_view`).
- Add games via **barcode scan**, **shared-catalog search**, or **manual entry**.
- Edit via `EditGameModal` / `EditWishlistModal`.
- **Future (from backlog):** move games between Collection ↔ Wishlist; normalize
  special characters in titles for display/sort/search.

### 5.3 Game Data, Barcode & BGG Enrichment
- Games live in a **shared catalog** (`shared_games`) keyed by barcode; user
  ownership is a join (`user_library`). This means barcode/BGG enrichment benefits
  all users.
- Barcode scanning in-browser via `html5-qrcode` (`BarcodeScanner`), supporting
  UPC-A (12) and EAN-13 (13) with prefix/strip variations on lookup.
- Lookups proxied through Edge Functions: `barcode-lookup`, `bgg-lookup`,
  `submit-barcode-mapping`. BGG enrichment fills name, year, cover, publisher,
  player count, playtime, age, type/category/mechanic/family, description.

### 5.4 Game Nite Tools
1. **Game Chooser** — randomized "spin the wheel" pick from a chosen set of games.
2. **First Player** — animated card-shuffle reveal that picks a starting player
   (rich CSS keyframe animation; honors `prefers-reduced-motion`).
3. **Turn Timer** — per-player turn countdown.
4. **Game Timer** — tracks a full session; timer state persists in profile
   preferences so it survives reloads.

Desktop shows tools as a tab bar; mobile shows a card grid that transitions into a
single-tool view.

### 5.5 Sessions & Victory Tracking
- Record `game_sessions` (date, duration, player count, notes) with per-player
  `session_victories` (winner flag, score, placement) via `VictoryLogModal`.
- Derived **victory stats** per game and per user: total sessions, total wins, win
  rate, best score, last played — surfaced on cards and the dashboard.

### 5.6 Friends & Shared Libraries
- Friend requests/relationships (`user_friends`: pending/accepted/blocked) via
  `FriendsManager`.
- Grant access to your collection (`shared_library_access`: `view` or `suggest`).
- Browse a friend's catalog (`SharedLibraryView`) and search across shared
  collections (`SearchSharedGamesModal`).

### 5.7 Dashboard
Composed of focused cards: `QuickStats`, `StatCard`, `MostPlayedGames`,
`PlayActivityChart`, `RecentlyAddedGames`, `VictoryStatsCard`, `QuickActions`.
Quick actions deep-link into other tabs (e.g. straight into a Game Nite tool).

### 5.8 Admin
`AdminPanel` for catalog/data management (admin-gated). Scope intentionally
loosely defined here — treat as an internal tool, not a user-facing surface.

## 6. Design System & Visual Guidelines

The product's aesthetic is a **vintage/botanical "library" feel**: warm parchment
backgrounds, serif display type, subtle paper/linen texture, thin rules, and flat
(borderless-elevation) surfaces. This section is the **canonical token reference
for both apps**.

### 6.1 Color Palette
Seven named ramps plus semantic aliases. Hex values are shared verbatim with the
Flutter app (`app_colors.dart`).

| Ramp | Role | Key values |
|------|------|-----------|
| **parchment** | Backgrounds / surfaces (cream) | `50 #FDF8F0` … `400 #C9AE78` |
| **forest** | Green — success / nature accent | `50 #EDF4ED` … `700 #0B2014` |
| **sky** | Teal — info / cool accent | `50 #EAF4F4` … `600 #0D3E3E` |
| **clay / terracotta** | Warm brand accent / error-adjacent | `50 #FDF2EC` … `600 #5E2509` |
| **wheat / gold** | Favorites / stars / warning | `50 #FEFAEE` … `600 #5C3E03` |
| **plum** | Shared / friends / "magic" accent | `50 #F5EEF8` … `600 #2E0D46` |
| **ink** | Text & dark neutrals | `50 #ECE9E3` … `600 #1A1610` |

**Semantic aliases (web, from `index.css`):**
- Backgrounds: base `parchment-50`, surface `parchment-100`, elevated `#fff`,
  overlay `rgba(26,22,16,0.55)`.
- Text: primary `ink-600`, secondary `ink-400`, muted `ink-200`, inverse `parchment-50`.
- Borders: subtle `parchment-200`, default `parchment-300`, strong `ink-200`.
- Brand: primary **`clay-400 #b85c28`**, hover `clay-500`, light `clay-100`.
- State: success `forest-400`, warning `wheat-400`, error `clay-500`, info `sky-400`.

> ⚠️ **Cross-platform brand divergence.** The **web** uses **clay/terracotta** as
> the primary brand color (nav indicators, mobile bottom nav `#b85c28`, avatar).
> The **Flutter** `ColorScheme.primary` is **forest green**. Same palette, different
> hero color. A deliberate decision is needed: pick one primary and align, or
> document this as an intentional per-surface choice. Until resolved, treat the
> shared *palette* as canonical and the *primary assignment* as platform-specific.

### 6.2 Typography
- **Display / headings:** Cormorant Garamond (serif), light/regular weights,
  `letter-spacing` ~0.5. Used for the wordmark, page titles, card titles.
- **Body / UI:** Jost (sans-serif), weights 300–600.
- **Mono / data:** DM Mono — numbers, timers, stat figures, code-like values.
- Buttons use Jost 500 with wide tracking (uppercase-ish label feel).

### 6.3 Shape, Texture & Elevation
- **Radius:** a flat **4px** everywhere (`sm`→`3xl` all collapse to 4px). Avoid
  pill/rounded shapes; the brand reads as crisp and printed.
- **Elevation:** prefer **borders over shadows**. Cards are white with a thin
  `parchment-200/300` border and little/no shadow.
- **Texture:** subtle SVG fractal-noise overlay on the page body (`opacity ~0.03`)
  and a `.linen-texture` utility for surfaces (`opacity ~0.05`). Texture should
  stay barely-perceptible.
- **Rules:** thin 1px hairlines (`.thin-rule`, `.rule-line`) in border colors to
  divide content, evoking ruled paper / ledger lines.

### 6.4 Motion
- Default to restraint; motion is reserved for moments of delight (First Player
  card shuffle, Game Chooser spin).
- **Always** provide a `prefers-reduced-motion` fallback (existing animations
  degrade to a simple fade). New animated features must do the same.

### 6.5 Iconography & Brand Marks
- Icon set: `lucide-react`, drawn at light stroke weight (~1.5) to match the
  delicate type.
- Custom **Meeple** mark used as the brand/profile glyph.
- The desktop "wooden disc" active-tab indicator is a signature flourish — a
  layered radial-gradient token by section color (dashboard=clay, library=forest,
  game-nite=sky, admin=plum). Reuse this section-color mapping when adding nav.

### 6.6 Accessibility
- Maintain WCAG AA contrast — be careful pairing mid-ramp colors on parchment.
- Respect reduced-motion (above).
- All interactive controls must be reachable and labeled; the noise/linen texture
  must never reduce legibility.

---

## 7. Technical Architecture (for context)

- **Stack:** React 18 + TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind (custom theme = design tokens),
  `lucide-react`, `sonner` (toasts), `html5-qrcode`.
- **State:** React context (`AuthContext`); data access in `src/lib/*`
  (`games`, `sessions`, `players`, `dashboard`, `bgg`, `auth`, `supabase`).
- **Backend:** Supabase. Edge Functions: `bgg-lookup`, `barcode-lookup`,
  `submit-barcode-mapping`, `delete-account`. Data model centers on a **shared
  game catalog** (`shared_games`) with per-user join tables.
- **Hosting:** Netlify (see `netlify.toml`, `NETLIFY_*` docs).

---

## 8. Guidelines for Future Features

When proposing or building anything new on the web app:

1. **Reuse tokens, don't invent.** Pull color/type/spacing from §6 (Tailwind
   theme). New colors require a new named ramp added in *both* apps.
2. **Keep it flat & papery.** 4px radius, borders over shadows, hairline rules,
   whisper-light texture. No drop-shadow-heavy "material" cards.
3. **Serif for voice, sans for function, mono for numbers.** Stats/timers/scores
   render in DM Mono.
4. **Earn your motion** and ship a reduced-motion fallback.
5. **Respect the shared data model.** New collection data should extend the
   existing join-table pattern (shared catalog + per-user rows) so enrichment
   benefits everyone and RLS stays simple.
6. **Mind parity.** Note in the PR whether a feature should also land on mobile
   (and vice-versa). Track parity gaps explicitly (see §9).
7. **Proxy third-party calls** through Edge Functions; never embed external API
   tokens in the client.

---

## 9. Web ↔ Mobile Parity Snapshot

Features present on **web** but not yet (or only partially) on **Flutter**:
- Admin panel.
- Friends + shared-library browsing UI (data layer exists on mobile; screens are
  stubbed).
- Full dashboard widget set.
- Session / victory logging UI breadth.

Features the **Flutter** app has that web does not:
- **Dice Roller** Game Nite tool (with shake-to-roll gesture).

These gaps are intentional-for-now but should be tracked so the two surfaces
converge over time. See the Flutter PRD §7 for the mobile-side view.

## 10. Open Questions
1. Final product name / wordmark / domain identity (blocks branding cleanup).
2. Primary brand color: align web (clay) and mobile (forest), or keep per-surface?
3. Is `for_sale` a future marketplace seed or just metadata? Define or remove.
4. Should the web app adopt a real URL router for deep-linking/sharing views?
5. Scope and access model for the Admin panel (internal-only vs. power-user).
